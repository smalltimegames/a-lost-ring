A little people, with no beards, rough hairy feet, and quite round in the middle. They are fond of pipe weed and even fonder of breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Especially second breakfast, lunch, and dinner. What they aren’t fond of is adventure or doing anything unexpected. Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit who did things unexpected and had himself a grand adventure. And he has had nothing but trouble since. Trouble and a vast amount of treasure. Hobbits who didn’t know Bilbo would have assumed he was a Took (and he was, although not in name) as Tooks have a penchant for trouble.","\n",{"#":"CLASS: text"},"^I only mention Mr. Baggins because he had an adventure. And on that adventure he came across a magic ring. This magic ring, by the most unlikely of circumstances, was a ring of power, in fact it was <em>the</em> ring of power, and that was no good and led to plenty of trouble.  What you may not know, is that there are in fact, many rings that aren’t rings of power at all. Magic rings that don’t attract a lot of attention and trouble. These magic rings are spread across Middle Earth and I would very much like your help finding one.","\n",{"#":"CLASS: text"},"^If you are - like most hobbits - opposed to adventure, I promise you can help from your comfortable hobbit-hole, a book in one hand and pipe in the other.

Before forging the seven and the nine with Sauron, Celebrimbor and the elves had crafted many lesser rings. These lesser rings, like the three rings of the elves, Fíriel imagined as untainted by the dark lord and simply lost. She, not being quite as wise as the hobbits of legend, Bilbo and Frodo, and not as studied as Meriadoc Brandybuck, decided this was a goal a young hobbit could achieve. After all, why not? Her grandfather walked into Mordor; why shouldn’t a Fíriel be able to find a much less important, much less dangerous ring? And so, sneaking some old maps from Bag End, she left the Shire.","\n",{"#":"CLASS: text"},"^First, Fíriel decided to find where the rings could be made. The one ring being made - and unmade - in the fires of Mt Doom, had shown that the forging of the ring required heat beyond that of mortal forges.
