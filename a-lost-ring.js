A little people, with no beards, rough hairy feet, and known to be quite round in the middle. They are fond of pipe weed and even fonder of breakfast lunch and dinner, especially second breakfast, lunch and dinner. What they aren’t fond of is adventure or doing anything unexpected. Bilbo Baggins was a hobbit who did things unexpected and had a grand adventure. And he has had nothing but trouble since. Trouble and a vast amount of treasure. Hobbits who didn’t know Bilbo would have assumed he was a Took (and he was, although not in name) as Tooks have a penchant for trouble.","\n",{"#":"CLASS: text"},"^Mr. Baggins however, is only relevant to this story because he had an adventure. And on that adventure he came across a magic ring. This magic ring happened to be a ring of power, in fact it was the ring of power, and that was no good and led to plenty of trouble.  What you may not know, is that there are, in fact, many rings that aren’t rings of power at all. Magic rings that don’t attract a lot of attention and trouble. These magic rings are spread across Middle Earth and I would much like your help finding one.","\n",{"#":"CLASS: text"},"^If you are a hobbit and opposed to adventure, I promise you can help from your comfortable hobbit-hole, a book in one hand and pipe in the other.

Before forging the seven and the nine with Sauron, Celebrimbor and the elves had crafted many lesser rings, in pursuit of creating rings of higher power. These lesser rings, like the three rings of the elves, Fíriel imagined as untainted by the dark lord and simply lost. She, not being quite as wise as the hobbits of legend, Bilbo and Frodo, and not as studied as Meriadoc Brandybuck decided this was a goal a young hobbit could achieve. After all, why not? her grandfather walked into Mordor; why shouldn’t a Fíriel be able to find a much less important, much less dangerous ring? And so, sneaking some old maps from Bag End, she left the shire.","\n",{"#":"CLASS: text"},"^First, she decided to find where the rings could be made. The one ring being made, and unmade, in the fires of Mt Doom, had shown that the forging of the ring required heat not known to mortal forges.
